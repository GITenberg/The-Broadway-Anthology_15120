<span>He was a burly Dutch tenor,<br /></span>
<span>And I patiently trailed him in his waking and sleeping hours<br /></span>
<span>That I might not lose a story,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>But his life was commonplace and unimaginative&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Air raids and abdications kept his activities,<br /></span>
<span>(A game of bridge yesterday, a ride to Tarrytown),<br /></span>
<span>Out of the papers.<br /></span>
<span>I watchfully waited,<br /></span>
<span>Yearning a coup that would place him on the<br /></span>
<span>Musical map.<br /></span>
<span>A coup, such as kissing a Marshal Joffre,<br /></span>
<span>Aeroplaning over the bay,<br /></span>
<span>Diving with Annette Kellerman.<br /></span>
<span>Then for three days I quit the city<br /></span>
<span>To get a simple contralto into the western papers.<br /></span>
<span>Returning I entered my office; the phone jangled.<br /></span>
<span>The burly tenor was tearfully sobbing and moaning over the wire;<br /></span>
<span>Tremor and emotion choked his throat.<br /></span>
<span>This was his ominous message:<br /></span>
<span>A taxicab accident almost had killed him two and one half days ago;<br /></span>
<span>He had escaped with his body and orchid-lined voice&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And not a line in the mornings or evenings!<br /></span>
<span>What could I do about it?<br /></span>
<span>Accidents will happen.<br /></span>

<h2>THE BARITONE</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>He was a wonderful Metropolitan singer.<br /></span>
<span>His name had been blazoned over these United States,<br /></span>
<span>And in Europe it was as well known.<br /></span>
<span>Records of him could be bought in the smallest hamlet;<br /></span>
<span>Nothing but praise had been shed upon the glory of his name.<br /></span>
<span>In May he was scheduled to sing in Chicago<br /></span>
<span>At a festival where thousands were to foregather<br /></span>
<span>To do praise to him and his voice.<br /></span>
<span>Two days before he left, he came to his manager's office<br /></span>
<span>With a sickly expression all over his rotund face<br /></span>
<span>And a deathly gasp in his voice.<br /></span>
<span>One thought he needed a doctor,<br /></span>
<span>Or the first aid of some Red Cross nurses.<br /></span>
<span>He was ushered into the private office<br /></span>
<span>To find out his trouble.<br /></span>
<span>This was his lament in short;<br /></span>
<span>A friend, in the hurry of the moment,<br /></span>
<span>Had procured tickets for him on the Twentieth Century<br /></span>
<span>Which demanded an extra fare of six dollars,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And he wanted to ride on the cheapest train.<br /></span>
<span>So we got him tickets on another road<br /></span>
<span>Which takes thirty six hours to Chicago and perhaps more,<br /></span>
<span>And the great singer, whose name has been blazoned over these United States<br /></span>
<span>And was as well known in Europe,<br /></span>
<span>Walked out contented and smiling like a young boy.<br /></span>

<h2>PATRIOTISM</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>The patriotic orchestra of eighty five men<br /></span>
<span>Was keyed to an extraordinary patriotic pitch<br /></span>
<span>For these were patriotic concerts,<br /></span>
<span>Supported by the leading patriots of the town,<br /></span>
<span>(Including a Bulgarian merchant, an Austrian physician and a German lawyer),<br /></span>
<span>And all the musicians were getting union wages&mdash;and in the summer at that.<br /></span>
<span>So they were patriotic too.<br /></span>
<span>The Welsh conductor was also patriotic,<br /></span>
<span>For his name on the program was larger than that of the date or the hall,<br /></span>
<span>But when the manager asked him to play a number<br /></span>
<span>Designated as &quot;Dixie,&quot;<br /></span>
<span>He disposed of it shortly with the words:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;It is too trivial&mdash;that music.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>And, instead, he played a lullaby by an unknown Welsh composer,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>(Because he was a Welshman)....<br /></span>
<span>The audience left after the concert was over<br /></span>
<span>And complimented itself individually and collectively on &quot;doing its bit&quot;<br /></span>
<span>By attending and listening to these patriotic concerts.<br /></span>

<h2>THE PILLOW CASES</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>The train was due to arrive at eleven that night,<br /></span>
<span>But owing to the usual delay it did not arrive until one.<br /></span>
<span>The reporters of the leading dailies<br /></span>
<span>Were still waiting grouchily on the station platform for the great star.<br /></span>
<span>For weeks his name had blotted out every bare wall,<br /></span>
<span>And the date sheets of his coming had reddened the horizon.<br /></span>
<span>Now he steps off the train, tired and disgruntled.<br /></span>
<span>What cares he for the praise of the public and their prophets<br /></span>
<span>Awaiting him impatiently at the station?<br /></span>
<span>It's a bed he wants&mdash;any bed will do;<br /></span>
<span>The quicker he gets it, the better for the song on the morrow.<br /></span>
<span>But in cooking the news for the public<br /></span>
<span>One a.m. is the same thing as noon day.<br /></span>
<span>So they rushed the star with these questions:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Not conscripted yet?...&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;How do you like this town?...&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Will you give any encores tomorrow?...&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;When will the war end?...&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Ruthlessly he plowed through them,<br /></span>
<span>Like a British tank at Messines.<br /></span>
<span>The tenor wanted a bed,<br /></span>
<span>But Lesville wanted a story....<br /></span>
<span>On the platform patiently nestled were twenty six pieces of luggage,<br /></span>
<span>Twenty six pieces of luggage, containing more than their content,<br /></span>
<span>Twenty six pieces of luggage would get him the story, he had not given himself.<br /></span>
<span>Craftily, one lured the reporters to look on this bulging baggage,<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Pillows and pillows and pillows ...&quot; was whispered,<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Tonight he will sleep on them.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Vulture-like swooped down the porters,<br /></span>
<span>Bearing them off to the taxis.<br /></span>
<span>Next morning the papers carried the story:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Singer Transports His Own Bedding,&quot;<br /></span>
<span>But the artist slept soundly on Ostermoors that night.<br /></span>
<span>The baggage held scores for the orchestra.<br /></span>

<h2>BETTER INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>He was the head of a large real estate firm,<br /></span>
<span>And his avocation was seeking the good in a Better Industrial Relations Society.<br /></span>
<span>They were going to have an exhibit in their church building,<br /></span>
<span>At which it was to be proved<br /></span>
<span>That giving a gold watch for an invention<br /></span>
<span>That made millions for the factory owner<br /></span>
<span>Was worthwhile.<br /></span>
<span>But they needed a press agent<br /></span>
<span>To let the world and themselves<br /></span>
<span>Know that what they were doing was good.<br /></span>
<span>I was chosen for the work,<br /></span>
<span>But the head of the large real estate firm<br /></span>
<span>Thought that half a column a day was too little<br /></span>
<span>To record the fact that a cash register company<br /></span>
<span>In which he owned stock<br /></span>
<span>Had presented a medal to an employee who had remained with them<br /></span>
<span>At the same salary for fifteen years.<br /></span>
<span>So he had me fired.<br /></span>
<span>And the Better Industrial Relations Exhibit was a great success.<br /></span>
<span>And many of the morning and evening newspapers<br /></span>
<span>Ran editorials about it.<br /></span>

<h2>THE PRIMA DONNA</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>She had been interviewed at all possible times,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>And sometimes the interviews came at impossible ones;<br /></span>
<span>But it did not matter to her<br /></span>
<span>As long as the stories were printed and her name was spelt correctly.<br /></span>
<span>So we sent a photographer to the hotel one day<br /></span>
<span>To take pictures of her in her drawing room.<br /></span>
<span>He was an ungentle photographer<br /></span>
<span>Who had been accustomed to take pictures of young women<br /></span>
<span>Coming into the harbor on shipboard, and no photograph was complete<br /></span>
<span>Without limbs being crossed or suchwise.<br /></span>
<span>But she did not mind even that,<br /></span>
<span>If the pictures were published the next day.<br /></span>
<span>He took a great number of her in her salon,<br /></span>
<span>And departed happy at the day's bagging.<br /></span>
<span>A great international disturbance reduced all the white space available<br /></span>
<span>And no photographs were printed the next day<br /></span>
<span>Of the prima donna.<br /></span>
<span>And when I met her at rehearsal, she said very shortly:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Je vous ne parle plus&quot; and looked at me harshly.<br /></span>
<span>Was I to blame for the international situation?<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Though bandsmen's notes from the street below resound,<br /></span>
<span>And the voices of jubilant masses proclaim a glorious holiday,<br /></span>
<span>I painstakingly pick out words on the typewriter,<br /></span>
<span>By fits and starts, thinking up a story about the great Metropolitan tenor.<br /></span>
<span>The typewriter keys now hold no rhythmic tingle.<br /></span>
<span>But the local manager in Iowa wants the story.<br /></span>
<span>He has engaged the great tenor for a date next March<br /></span>
<span>When the Tuesday musicale ladies give their annual benefit for the Shriners.<br /></span>
<span>He wants the concert to be such a success,<br /></span>
<span>That his Iowan town will henceforth be in the foreground<br /></span>
<span>Of Iowan towns, as far as music is concerned.<br /></span>
<span>So he has wired in for this tale about the singer,<br /></span>
<span>A story about his wife and baby, and what the baby eats per diem.<br /></span>
<span>And though the call is to the street below,<br /></span>
<span>Where jubilant masses proclaim the holiday,<br /></span>
<span>I must finish the story about the tenor's wife and baby<br /></span>
<span>To put the Iowan town in the foreground, as far as music is concerned.<br /></span>

<h2>THE DISTRIBUTION OF CREDIT</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>The Irish prize play had come back to Broadway.<br /></span>
<span>Where to put the credit? On the astute manager<br /></span>
<span>Who saw in it<br /></span>
<span>A year of Broadway, two of stock, eternity in the movies;<br /></span>
<span>Or the League of Public Spirited Women<br /></span>
<span>Banded together to uplift the Drama&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>That was the question stirring dramatic circles and the public.<br /></span>
<span>It had failed in its first run of three weeks at an uptown theatre<br /></span>
<span>Miserably,<br /></span>
<span>Despite glowing reviews in all the dailies.<br /></span>
<span>But this come-back<br /></span>
<span>At a Broadway theatre, with electric lights, and transient crowds<br /></span>
<span>That would save it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Was the universal verdict.<br /></span>
<span>During the first week there was a tremendous fight<br /></span>
<span>Between the two factions for the<br /></span>
<span>Distribution of credit, and some critics said<br /></span>
<span>The League of Public Spirited Women was responsible<br /></span>
<span>For bringing the play back, because they had bulletined it,<br /></span>
<span>And others said it was the astute manager.<br /></span>
<span>But no audience came to the play after the second week.<br /></span>
<span>And it went to the storehouse.<br /></span>
<span>No one fought any longer for<br /></span>
<span>The distribution of credit.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>Beads of perspiration on a hot summer's afternoon,<br /></span>
<span>A hurry call from the Ritz,<br /></span>
<span>Thoughts of plastering the city in half an hour,<br /></span>
<span>With twenty-four sheets and large heralds,<br /></span>
<span>And a page or two in all the dailies....<br /></span>
<span>She sat in a sumptuous suite at the Ritz,<br /></span>
<span>Discussing with her husband,<br /></span>
<span>Who had just returned from the beagles in South Carolina<br /></span>
<span>Her new pet charity;<br /></span>
<span>And she had called me in at this very moment,<br /></span>
<span>Because she had struck a snag.<br /></span>
<span>This was her charity:<br /></span>
<span>She related with tears in her eyes,<br /></span>
<span>What was she to do about it?<br /></span>
<span>She received no response from the American public.<br /></span>
<span>The poor assistant stagehands of the Paris theatres<br /></span>
<span>They were out of work&mdash;destitute&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>The theatres closed&mdash;and all the actors at the front.<br /></span>
<span>But what could be done for them, the poor Paris stagehands?<br /></span>
<span>That was her query.<br /></span>
<span>And tears welled up in her eyes, as she spoke<br /></span>
<span>While her husband chased the Angora from under the sofa&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>I sat and discussed the question.<br /></span>
<span>And tears came to my eyes,<br /></span>
<span>But my tears were wept for another reason.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>I had ordered the photographs of the prima donna.<br /></span>
<span>They are lovely and beautiful to behold and they are printed before me in magazine.<br /></span>
<span>Her madonna like face sheds radiance on the prospective box-office patron;<br /></span>
<span>He is dazzled by her sun-like head of hair;<br /></span>
<span>He loses his heart and his pocket-book when he glances on them.<br /></span>
<span>I felt happy that I changed photographers.<br /></span>
<span>I felt that my discovery of a new artisan of the sensitized plate<br /></span>
<span>Would bring glory and money to many.<br /></span>
<span>I sit by the rolltop desk and pull out again the objects of my praises.<br /></span>
<span>The telephone bell rings and awakens me from my reveries,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>It is the voice of the beautiful prima donna herself;<br /></span>
<span>But the melodious notes the critics have praised are changed.<br /></span>
<span>There is a raucous, strident tone in the voice;<br /></span>
<span>It sounds like the rasping bark of the harpies.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;How dare you use those terrible photographs?<br /></span>
<span>&quot;What do you mean by insulting my beauty?&quot;<br /></span>
<span>There is a slam down of the telephone receiver,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>I turn to my work of writing an advertisement about the prima donna's voice.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>By many names men call me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Press agent, publicity promoter, faker;<br /></span>
<span>Ofttimes the short and simple liar.<br /></span>
<span>Charles A. Dana told me<br /></span>
<span>I was a buccaneer<br /></span>
<span>On the high seas of journalism.<br /></span>
<span>Many a newspaper business manager<br /></span>
<span>Has charged me<br /></span>
<span>With selling his space<br /></span>
<span>Over his head.<br /></span>
<span>Every one loves me<br /></span>
<span>When I get his name into print&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>For this is an age of publicity<br /></span>
<span>And he who bloweth not his own horn<br /></span>
<span>The same shall not be blown.<br /></span>
<span>I have sired, nursed and reared<br /></span>
<span>Many reputations.<br /></span>
<span>Few men or women have I found<br /></span>
<span>Scornful of praise or blame<br /></span>
<span>In the press.<br /></span>
<span>The folk of the stage<br /></span>
<span>Live on publicity,<br /></span>
<span>Yet to the world they pretend to dislike it,<br /></span>
<span>Though wildly to me they plead for it, cry for it,<br /></span>
<span>Ofttimes do that for it<br /></span>
<span>Which must make the God Notoriety<br /></span>
<span>Grin at the weakness of mortals.<br /></span>
<span>I hold a terrible power<br /></span>
<span>And sometimes my own moderation<br /></span>
<span>Amazes me,<br /></span>
<span>For I can abase as well as elevate,<br /></span>
<span>Tear down as well as build up.<br /></span>
<span>I know all the ways of fair speaking<br /></span>
<span>And can lead my favorites<br /></span>
<span>To fame and golden rewards.<br /></span>
<span>There are a thousand channels<br /></span>
<span>Through which press agency can exploit<br /></span>
<span>Its star or its movement<br /></span>
<span>Never obvious but like the submarine<br /></span>
<span>Submersible beneath the sea<br /></span>
<span>Of publicity.<br /></span>
<span>But I know, too, of the ways<br /></span>
<span>That undo in Manhattan.<br /></span>
<span>There are bacilli of rumor<br /></span>
<span>That slip through the finest of filters<br /></span>
<span>And defy the remedial serums<br /></span>
<span>Of angry denial.<br /></span>
<span>Pin a laugh to your tale<br /></span>
<span>When stalking your enemy<br /></span>
<span>And not your exile nor your death<br /></span>
<span>Will stay the guffaws of merriment<br /></span>
<span>As the story flies<br /></span>
<span>Through the Wicked Forties<br /></span>
<span>And on to the &quot;Road.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Laughter gives the rumor strong wings.<br /></span>
<span>Truly the press agent,<br /></span>
<span>Who knows his psychology,<br /></span>
<span>Likewise his New York<br /></span>
<span>In all of its ramifications,<br /></span>
<span>And has a nimble wit,<br /></span>
<span>Can play fast and loose<br /></span>
<span>With the lives of many.<br /></span>
<span>Nevertheless he has no great reward,<br /></span>
<span>And most in the theatre<br /></span>
<span>Draw fatter returns than he.<br /></span>
<span>Yet is he called upon to make the show,<br /></span>
<span>To save the show,<br /></span>
<span>But never is he given credit<br /></span>
<span>Comparable to that which falls<br /></span>
<span>Upon the slightest jester or singer or dancer<br /></span>
<span>Who mugs, mimes, or hoofs in a hit.<br /></span>
<span>Yet is the press agent happy;<br /></span>
<span>He loves his work;<br /></span>
<span>It has excitement and intrigue;<br /></span>
<span>And to further the cause of beautiful women,<br /></span>
<span>To discover the wonderful girls of the theatre,<br /></span>
<span>And lead them in progress triumphal<br /></span>
<span>Till their names outface the jealous night,<br /></span>
<span>On Broadway, in incandescents,<br /></span>
<span>Is in itself a privilege.<br /></span>
<span>That compensates<br /></span>
<span>For the wisdom of the cub reporter,<br /></span>
<span>The amusement of the seasoned editor,<br /></span>
<span>Shredding the cherished story<br /></span>
<span>And uprooting the flourishing &quot;plant&quot;;<br /></span>
<span>Makes one forgive<br /></span>
<span>The ingratitude of artists arrived.<br /></span>
<span>They who do not love me<br /></span>
<span>I hope to have fear me;<br /></span>
<span>There is only one hell,<br /></span>
<span>And that is to be disregarded.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>August heat cannot weaken nor flivvers stale<br /></span>
<span>Our first-night expectance when the new season opens.<br /></span>
<span>Come on, boys and girls, the gang's all here;<br /></span>
<span>The Death Watch is ready in orchestra chairs<br /></span>
<span>Still shrouded in summer's cool slip pajamas,<br /></span>
<span>And the undertakers of stage reputations<br /></span>
<span>Are gathered to chatter about author and players,<br /></span>
<span>And give them and their work disrespectful interment<br /></span>
<span>By gleefully agreeing in that sage Broadway saying:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Oh, what an awful oil can that piece turned out to be!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>It's hard when the Chanters of Death-House Blues<br /></span>
<span>Have to turn to each other and reluctantly murmur:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;I'm afraid it's a hit&mdash;the poor fish is lucky.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>First-nighters are the theatre's forty-niners,<br /></span>
<span>Making the early rush to new dramatic gold fields,<br /></span>
<span>And usually finding them barren.<br /></span>
<span>Often must it madden the playwright to offer his ideals<br /></span>
<span>To an audience whose personnel would for the most part<br /></span>
<span>Regard an ideal as a symptom of sickness;<br /></span>
<span>To show sweetness and beauty and color<br /></span>
<span>To those whose knowledge of tints is confined<br /></span>
<span>To the rouge and the lip stick on dressers;<br /></span>
<span>To pioneer in playwrighting, to delve deep into mind,<br /></span>
<span>When all that the first-nighters ask is plain entertainment.<br /></span>
<span>How much of the great, wholesome public, hard-working and normal,<br /></span>
<span>To whom the final appeal must be made<br /></span>
<span>Frequents our first nights on Broadway?<br /></span>
<span>Costumers, friends of the author, and critics,<br /></span>
<span>Scene painters, all of the tradesmen concerned,<br /></span>
<span>Kinsfolk of mummers even to the third generation,<br /></span>
<span>Wine agents, hot-house ladies, unemployed players,<br /></span>
<span>Hearty laughers or ready weepers &quot;planted.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Most of them there prepare for a funeral;<br /></span>
<span>Their diversion is nodding to friends and acquaintances,<br /></span>
<span>And he or she who nods the most times<br /></span>
<span>Is thereby the greatest first-nighter.<br /></span>
<span>Some managers open to hand-picked audiences,<br /></span>
<span>Others strive to escape the regulars;<br /></span>
<span>But the majority seek for the standardized premier faces<br /></span>
<span>That really mean so little in the life of the play.<br /></span>
<span>Listen to the comments during intermission:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;It doesn't get over!&quot; &quot;It's a flop!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;What atmosphere!&quot; &quot;An absolute steal!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Such originality!&quot; &quot;Not a bit life-like!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;That author has a wonderful memory!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;He copped that lyric from Irving Berlin!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;He's as funny as a crutch or a cry for help!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;They grabbed that number in London!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;She's one of his tigers!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;From a Lucile model, my dear, but home-made!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;I can't hand him anything on this one!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Some heavy-sugar papa backed the production!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Isn't my boy wonderful!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Yes, but my girl is running away with the piece!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;If you like this, you're not well!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;What could be sweeter!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;What large feet she has!&quot; &quot;His Adam's apple annoys me!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;She must get her clothes on Avenue A!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;They say she was born there!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;What an awful sunburn!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Best thing in years!&quot; &quot;The storehouse for this one!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Did you catch her going up in her lines?&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Yes, and he's fluffing all over the place!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Splendidly produced, don't you think?&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;I think the stage direction is rotten!&quot;<br /></span>
<span>So I suggest the old Roman fashion of presenting,<br /></span>
<span>The artists, like gladiators crying:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;We, who are about to die, salute you!&quot;<br /></span>

<span>I've put one over at last!<br /></span>
<span>My play with the surprise finish is a bear.<br /></span>
<span>Al Woods wants to read all of my scripts;<br /></span>
<span>Georgie Cohan speaks to me as an equal<br /></span>
<span>And the office boy swings the gate without being asked.<br /></span>
<span>I don't care if the manager's name is as large as the play's<br /></span>
<span>Or if the critics are featured all over the ash cans.<br /></span>
<span>I'm going to get mine and I'm going to live.<br /></span>
<span>A Rolls-Royce for me and trips &quot;up the road,&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Long Beach and pretty girls, big eats at the Ritz<br /></span>
<span>And the ice pitcher for the fellows who snubbed me.<br /></span>
<span>How the other reporters laughed<br /></span>
<span>When I showed my first script and started to peddle!<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Stick to the steady job,&quot; they advised.<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Play writing is too big a gamble;<br /></span>
<span>It will never keep your nose in the feed bag.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>I wrote a trunkful of junk; did a play succeed,<br /></span>
<span>I immediately copied the fashion;<br /></span>
<span>Like a pilfering tailor I stole the new models.<br /></span>
<span>Kind David Belasco, with his face in the gloom,<br /></span>
<span>And mine brightly lighted, said ministerially:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Rather crude yet, my boy, but the way to write a play<br /></span>
<span>Is to write plays from sunrise to sunset<br /></span>
<span>And rewrite them long after midnight.<br /></span>
<span>Try, try, try, my boy, and God bless you.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Broke and disgusted, I became a play reader<br /></span>
<span>And the &quot;yessir man&quot; to a manager.<br /></span>
<span>I was a play doctor, too.<br /></span>
<span>A few of my patients lived<br /></span>
<span>And I learned about drama from them.<br /></span>
<span>How we gutted the scripts!<br /></span>
<span>Grabbing a wonderful line, a peach of a scene,<br /></span>
<span>A gem of a finish<br /></span>
<span>Out of the rubbish that struggling poor devils<br /></span>
<span>Borrowed money to typewrite and mail to us.<br /></span>
<span>It's like opening oysters looking for pearls,<br /></span>
<span>But pearls are to be found and out of the shell heaps<br /></span>
<span>Come jewels that, polished and set by a clever artificer,<br /></span>
<span>Are a season's theatrical wonder.<br /></span>
<span>Finally came my own big idea.<br /></span>
<span>I wrote and rewrote and cast and recast,<br /></span>
<span>Convinced the manager, got a production.<br /></span>
<span>Here am I young and successful,<br /></span>
<span>And Walter and Thomas and Selwyn have nothing on me.<br /></span>
<span>Press agents are hired to praise me.<br /></span>
<span>Watch for my next big sensation,<br /></span>

<span>Early he turned from his fiddle<br /></span>
<span>To write popular songs<br /></span>
<span>And tunes so whistly and catchy<br /></span>
<span>That the music of a child<br /></span>
<span>Enraptured the nation.<br /></span>
<span>Then followed comedy sketches,<br /></span>
<span>Gay little pieces that made public<br /></span>
<span>And player-folk chatter of Cohan.<br /></span>
<span>Later, essaying the musical comedy,<br /></span>
<span>He wrote &quot;Running for Office,&quot;<br /></span>
<span>To be followed by that impudent<br /></span>
<span>Classic of fresh young America,<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Little Johnnie Jones.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>One followed another in rapid succession;<br /></span>
<span>His name grew a cherished possession,<br /></span>
<span>And ever his dancing delighted.<br /></span>
<span>His manner of singing and speaking<br /></span>
<span>Provoked to endless imitation.<br /></span>
<span>His personality became better known<br /></span>
<span>Then the President's.<br /></span>
<span>Always he soared in ambition<br /></span>
<span>And, becoming a lord of the theatre,<br /></span>
<span>He ventured on serious drama,<br /></span>
<span>And out of his wisdom and watching<br /></span>
<span>Wrote masterful plays,<br /></span>
<span>Envisaging the types of our natives.<br /></span>
<span>Truly a genius,<br /></span>
<span>Genius in friendship, genius in stagecraft,<br /></span>
<span>Genius in life!<br /></span>
<span>Even in choosing a partner<br /></span>
<span>He fattened his average,<br /></span>
<span>Batting four hundred<br /></span>
<span>By taking a kindred irreverent soul,<br /></span>
<span>Graduated out of the whirlpool<br /></span>
<span>That wrecks all but the strongest,<br /></span>
<span>Born on the eastern edge<br /></span>
<span>Of Manhattan,<br /></span>
<span>Sam H. Harris, man of business,<br /></span>
<span>Who to the skill of the trader<br /></span>
<span>Adds the joy in life<br /></span>
<span>And the sense of humor,<br /></span>
<span>Coupled with pleasure in giving<br /></span>
<span>And helping<br /></span>
<span>That Cohan demands of his pals.<br /></span>
<span>Together they plan wonderful projects,<br /></span>
<span>And the artist soul<br /></span>
<span>And the soul of commerce<br /></span>
<span>Are an unbeatable union.<br /></span>
<span>Best of all about Cohan<br /></span>
<span>Is his congenital manliness.<br /></span>
<span>He sees Americans<br /></span>
<span>As our soil and our air and our water<br /></span>
<span>Have made them;<br /></span>
<span>Types as distinct as the Indian.<br /></span>
<span>He follows no school,<br /></span>
<span>Knows little of movements artistic.<br /></span>
<span>A lonely creator,<br /></span>
<span>His friends are not writing men,<br /></span>
<span>Reformers, uplifters or zealots.<br /></span>
<span>He writes the life he has lived<br /></span>
<span>So fully and zestfully,<br /></span>
<span>And over it all plays like sheet lightning<br /></span>
<span>A beneficent humor.<br /></span>
<span>Growth is his hall-mark,<br /></span>
<span>Hard work his chief recreation;<br /></span>
<span>Not Balzac could toil with labor titanic<br /></span>
<span>More terribly.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>King David of old slew the Philistines;<br /></span>
<span>Our David has made them admirers and patrons;<br /></span>
<span>He has numbered the people<br /></span>
<span>Night after night in his theatres.<br /></span>
<span>Will he ever, I wonder, send forth for the Shunammite?<br /></span>
<span>Many there be who would answer his calling,<br /></span>
<span>For he has shown ambitious fair women<br /></span>
<span>To acting's high places.<br /></span>
<span>As Rodin in marble saw wondrous creations<br /></span>
<span>To be freed by the chisel,<br /></span>
<span>So Belasco in immature genius and beauty<br /></span>
<span>Sees the resplendent star to be kindled<br /></span>
<span>At his own steady beacon.<br /></span>
<span>Too varied a mind for our comprehension,<br /></span>
<span>Too big and too broad and too subtle<br /></span>
<span>To be understood of the bourgeois American<br /></span>
<span>Whom he has led decade after decade<br /></span>
<span>By a nose ring artistic.<br /></span>
<span>Capable of everything, he has worked<br /></span>
<span>With the ease of a master, giving the public<br /></span>
<span>Marvelous detail, unfailing sensation and poses pictorial;<br /></span>
<span>Preferring the certain success to arduous striving<br /></span>
<span>For the more excellent things of the future.<br /></span>
<span>Like David his forebear, a king but no prophet,<br /></span>
<span>Amazingly wise in his own generation.<br /></span>
<span>A wizard in art of the everyday,<br /></span>
<span>Lord of the spotlight and dimmer,<br /></span>
<span>But nursing the unconquerable hope, the inviolable shade<br /></span>
<span>Of what in his dreams Oriental<br /></span>
<span>He fain would do, did not necessity drive him.<br /></span>
<span>His the fascination of a great personality.<br /></span>
<span>Who knoweth not him of the clerical collar?<br /></span>
<span>Hair of the sage and eyes of the poet,<br /></span>
<span>Features perfectly drawn and as mobile<br /></span>
<span>As those of the inspired actor;<br /></span>
<span>With speech so much blander than honey<br /></span>
<span>And insight that maketh his staged stumbling in bargains<br /></span>
<span>Cover the shrewdness of a masterly trader.<br /></span>
<span>None better than he knoweth the crowd and its likings,<br /></span>
<span>As to using the patter of drama artistic,<br /></span>
<span>That's where he lives.<br /></span>
<span>With incense and color and scenery<br /></span>
<span>He refilleth the bottle of art so that the contents<br /></span>
<span>Go twice better than in the original package.<br /></span>
<span>Thanks be to David for joy in the playhouse.<br /></span>
<span>Wizard, magician, necromancer of switchboards,<br /></span>
<span>He hath woven spells from the actual,<br /></span>
<span>Keeping ideals and ideas well in the background.<br /></span>
<span>Like Gautier, these things delight him:<br /></span>
<span>Gold, marble and purple; brilliance, solidity, color.<br /></span>
<span>He can stage Tiffany's jewels but not Maeterlinck's bees.<br /></span>
<span>Deep in his soul there are tempests<br /></span>
<span>Revealed in the storms of his dramas&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>Sandstorm and snowstorm, rainstorm and hurricane.<br /></span>
<span>That nature revealed in its subtle reactions<br /></span>
<span>Would show in its deeps the soul of an Angelo<br /></span>
<span>Subdued to success and dyed by democracy.<br /></span>
<span>Opportunism hath made him<br /></span>
<span>An artistic materialist.<br /></span>
<span>One work remains for David Belasco,<br /></span>
<span>And that is to stage with patient precision<br /></span>
<span>A cross section in drama of his own self-surprising,<br /></span>
<span>Making the world sit up and take notice<br /></span>
<span>With what &quot;masterly detail,&quot; &quot;unfailing atmosphere,&quot;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Startling reality&quot; he can star David Belasco.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span>I was not raised for vaudeville.<br /></span>
<span>Father and mother were veteran legits;<br /></span>
<span>They loved the Bard and the &quot;Lady of Lyons.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>I was born on a show boat on the Cumberland;<br /></span>
<span>I was carried on as a child<br /></span>
<span>When the farm girl revealed her shame<br /></span>
<span>On the night of the snowstorm.<br /></span>
<span>The old folks died with grease paint on their faces.<br /></span>
<span>I did a little of everything<br /></span>
<span>Even to staking out a pitch in a street fair.<br /></span>
<span>Hiram Grafter taught me to ballyhoo<br /></span>
<span>And to make openings.<br /></span>
<span>I stole the business of Billy Sunday<br /></span>
<span>And imitated William Jennings Bryan.<br /></span>
<span>I became famous in the small towns.<br /></span>
<span>One day Poli heard me&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>He's the head of the New England variety circuit.&mdash;<br /></span>
<span>&quot;Cul,&quot; he said, &quot;you are a born monologist.<br /></span>
<span>Where you got that stuff I don't know,<br /></span>
<span>But you would be a riot in the two-a-day.<br /></span>
<span>Quit this hanky-panky<br /></span>
<span>And I'll make you a headliner.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>Well, I fell for his line of talk<br /></span>
<span>Like the sod busters had fallen for mine.<br /></span>
<span>Aaron Hoffman wrote me a topical monologue;<br /></span>
<span>Max Marx made me a suit of clothes;<br /></span>
<span>And Lew Dockstader wised me up<br /></span>
<span>On how to jockey my laughs.<br /></span>
<span>I opened in Hartford;<br /></span>
<span>Believe me, I was some scream.<br /></span>
<span>I gave them gravy, and hokum,<br /></span>
<span>And when they ate it up I came through<br /></span>
<span>With the old jasbo,<br /></span>
<span>Than which there is nothing so efficacious<br /></span>
<span>In vaudeville, polite or otherwise.<br /></span>
<span>The first thing I did I hollered for more dough,<br /></span>
<span>And Poli says:<br /></span>
<span>&quot;That's what I get for feeding you meat,<br /></span>
<span>But you are a riot all right, all right,<br /></span>
<span>So I guess you are on for more kale.&quot;<br /></span>
<span>I kept getting better.<br /></span>
<span>I got so's I could follow any act at all<br /></span>
<span>And get my laughs.<br /></span>
<span>And he who getteth his laughs<br /></span>
<span>Is greater than he who taketh a city.<br /></span>
<span>At last the Palace Theatre sent for me<br /></span>
<span>And I signed up for a week.<br /></span>
<span>They kept me two.<br /></span>
<span>I am a headliner;<br /></span>
<span>I stand at the corner of Forty-seventh Street<br /></span>
<span>And Little Old Broadway;<br /></span>
<span>Throw out my chest,<br /></span>
<span>Call the agents and vaudeville magnates<br /></span>
<span>By their first names.<br /></span>
<span>I am a HEADLINER with a home in Freeport.<br /></span>

<span>Until the day she came to town<br /></span>
<span>I longed to see her dance.<br /></span>
<span>The night the dancer and her ballet came<br /></span>
<span>The Desk assigned me to my nightly run<br /></span>
<span>Of hotels, clubs, and undertakers' shops;<br /></span>
<span>I was so green<br /></span>
<span>I had not learned<br /></span>
<span>The art of using telephones<br /></span>
<span>To make it seem<br /></span>
<span>That I was hot upon the trail of news<br /></span>
<span>While loafing otherwhere.<br /></span>
<span>How could I do my trick<br /></span>

<span>Upon the April air;<br /></span>
<span>I'd seen the hawks arise and soar;<br /></span>

<span>Saying to the lesser chiefs<br /></span>
<span>That they should call the local tribe<br /></span>
<span>To meet beside the caravanserai<br /></span>
<span>Before another sun went down<br /></span>
<span>To see if these vain wandering men<br /></span>
<span>Could do one half the deeds they boasted.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span>So we met at sundown,<br /></span>
<span>Our brown men stripped<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span>Then as a climax the village boy essayed<br /></span>
<span>To span the four trained camels<br /></span>
<span>Who at Abdullah's soft-spoke word<br /></span>
<span>Moved just enough apart to make the boy fall short.<br /></span>
<span>And then our sinewed lad would make the leap,<br /></span>
<span>The camels crowding close together<br /></span>
<span>At another soft command.<br /></span>
<span>Our lad making good his jump,<br /></span>
<span>The populace would grant our greater skill;<br /></span>
<span>A goatskin filled with wine,<br /></span>
<span>And honey mixed with melted butter<br /></span>
<span>Was offered us within the caravanserai.<br /></span>
<span>Then we moved out beyond the town<br /></span>
<span>And pitched our tents of camels' hair,<br /></span>
<span>Rising before the sun to face the friendless desert wastes<br /></span>
<span>Until we reached another habitation on the camel trail,<br /></span>
<span>I (who played the dumb boy of the tribe<br /></span>
<span>Lest my Christian tongue betray me)<br /></span>
<span>Trudging behind with all the salary&mdash;<br /></span>

<span>There comes the tread of camels' feet,<br /></span>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
